DWM assignment no 2 ki last date thi aaj till 11 am.
college jake likhna tha & return aana tha, But nind itni thi ki ghar pe hi likha 8 se 10 am & college gaya.
College busstop pe Development ki bate, my app & all with mayank, sudhanva & talha then college gaya.
Assignment di cr sumit ko, to  sala tb time extended ka message daal raha tha wo bhi mere sath, koi na...
Yogi k sath CN baitha, Nishant k sath Abhishek sir se M3 kt paper reval ka pucha, ghar aaya.
4 pm se start kiya, pr wo ho hi nahi raha tha & finally ab jake 12:21 am @ 4 Oct 2023 ko Errors solved & got he selected services screen contaning problems from both screens in basic required mannner.
P.S. -->
Actually GPT code of both seprate problems screen me seprate class coded tha for slected services page ka, to wahi comment kiya to real wala page aa gaya usko GPT kiya to dono page k problems list ho gaye. Abhi ye page complete karna hai.
And ha Airoli pe bus hi nahi aa rhai thi & Nerul me trains hi rare the...wo panvel side issue thats why...


************* 4 Oct 2023 *************

Raat 1 am ko nind aa rahi thi & abh 5:45 am ko bhi, but ab kya... Slected services page which contains all problems selected by user are now available. Just pending to clear the data from list while user goes on mechanic services apge to user home page...wiil c
Abh...break karna hai- fast karna hai warna dopehar na aa jaye, nind se uthkar phir wapis chau karna hai.
Finally 1:32 pm baje, wo issue is soved, when user add problem & goes to home page & again enters in mechanic services page then in the cart no previous selected things shows.
Abi code for final commitment page code for to post order & further part...
But usse pehle list me, checkboxed tick kiye hue hi problem load karne k liye checkbox code correct kar raha tha jisme bugs hai jara;
pr abhi 8:30 pm ho gaye ek chote kaam k wahjse main kaam reh gaya map ka, kuch to ho jata.
So atleast for now, stop kar raha hu wo part.
Started part of Map page. Searched the videos after GPT failures & started the codeing but its not working. Will c different ways.


************* 5 Oct 2023 *************
Morning se thoda start kiya lunch tk, but ho hi nahi raha tha. GPT to kabka failed hua tha isliye & youtube ongoing tha.
Ghar pe hi tha, 2 pm se no work done. Just stand out @ Sumedha mam's message on official grp till 7 pm.
Sangle ka call for Android studio setup & Shivem ka call for CIBA meeting tommorrow.
Started all part for adding map, which went failed after every different approach ( i mean dependancy, videos, GPT++ & ...)


************* 6 Oct 2023 *************
College gaya, then mate super seniors & founders of Scrapnet in CIBA @ Vashi. Bate ki, mja aaya, ghar aaya & sogaya.


************* 7 Oct 2023 *************

Morning se continue kar raha tha, map ka part but nahi hua.Sare dependancies try kiya.Then called Shivam & did meet then Shivam code chal gaya @ 7 pm.
Abhi wo page customized kar raha hu.


************* 8 Oct 2023 *************

Morning se wo page cusomized ho hi nahi rahe.Baad me ab 10:30 ko ho gaye wo do page + map wala page. Animation bhi add kar diya.
Minimum one problem required wala case bhi applay kar diya let's confirm button pe.
Ab wo respective checkbox of sub problems ka code issue kar raha hu so respective sub problems add ho jaye instead of just single main problem (even though multiple sub problems are selected); so checkbox's marked status visibility ka bhi dekh leta hu.
Its 3:00 Am @ 9 Oct 2023 but still wo checkbox part thikse se sort hi nahi ho raha;
instant status nahi dikhta, dikhta hai back h=jake wapas aate hai tb, status remove hota hai jb idhar-udhar gaye to ya fir 2 bar back gaye to... ;Its getting hectic as GPT cannot hhandle it through one from all bottomsheet screens.
So abhi rakh raha hu but jate jate 2 approaches aaye hai wo kl implement karte hai.
A1: 
use checkbox as a button as well to change its status by changing the view of checkbox to other icon (may still not instant changes).. & add that by crosschecking checkbox@icon status
A2: 
Wo add button & checkbox hi remove karte hai &just text & snackbar show karte hai for to selected/deselected message so i guess (duplicasy na ho & remove bhi kar paye; ye handle kar paye).

Map page in mechanic  home page add kiya.
but drawer me data automatically fetch hona band ho gaya so wo dekha but nahi hua so finall ab temporary text add karke rakha hai.
Bich bich me dikh raha hai, pta nahi kya ho gaya.


************* 15 Oct 2023 *************
Main part i.e, to show the every new orders to mechanic in home & map page of mechanic & further part till finish the deal started.
Unfortunately step 1 i.e, mechanic ko show hi nai ho raha tha.
Firestore se realtime database pe shift kiya & w.r.t. that sare places pe change kar hi raha tha, to one moment pe bhot complex ho gaya, so againg reverted the changes to firestore.
Tried new approaches but its not working.
Ab sala wo notification hi nahi ashow kar paya to order kaise dikhaunga & fir kase pta chlega mechanic ko & fir kya he deal hogi;
udhar user wait karte baithega & idhar mechanic ko order hi nahi aayega, system barbaad ####.
Unfortuntely closing with this conclusion @ 16 Oct 2023 1:22 am.

ssee i am a computer engineering student from india. So for mini project i am making flutter application. Topic is, the app is basically a online platform for mechanics (will be user of app) & the deivers(also will be user of app ). If driver need a quick/emergency  mechanic service then user can post a issue & find the mechanics available to it with respect to timee, cost,.. And as the any user will post any issue, mechanics who are online will get the notification for order which is come, so he will accept or reject it as per his choice. If user post a issue & mechanic accepted it then mechanic will go to solve that. Till reaching user & mechanics both can see them on map. Once reached, mechanoc will solve issue & mark done on app just as a process & user will also mark done & will pay to mechanic & the session will end. Just relate this like  a ola or ubar app.                                   So now by searching, i got the similar app on github and luckyly thats app also in flutter. But that app i canot install on phone because dart 2.0 version is ussed for it which is now very old. And i am not a pro developer that i can upgrade that without any issue, so i come here to you for my work.              I am following that project & its structure extremely. So on my system i codded till register & login for both the user & mechanic.  So i am now giving you the all code of that github project file by file & thenmy project file by file. And then i will ask you for whatever required code part. ok ?
